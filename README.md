== Introduction ==

PARIS is a system for the automatic alignment of RDF ontologies. PARIS aligns
not only instances, but also relations and classes. Alignments at the instance
level cross-fertilize with alignments at the schema level. Thereby, our system
provides a truly holistic solution to the problem of ontology alignment. The
heart of the approach is probabilistic, i.e., we measure degrees of matchings
based on probability estimates. This allows PARIS to run without parameter
tuning. Experiments show that PARIS obtains a precision of around 90% in
experiments with some of the worldâ€™s largest ontologies.
