 *  This class represents an abstract base for implementing
 *  sets of byte values. All operations that can be implemented
 *  using iterators and the <tt>get()</tt> and <tt>set()</tt> methods
 *  are implemented as such. In most cases, this is
 *  hardly an efficient solution, and at least some of those
 *  methods should be overridden by sub-classes.
